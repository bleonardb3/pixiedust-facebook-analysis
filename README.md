# Uncover insights from Facebook with PixieDust and a cognitive Jupyter notebook

In this Code Pattern, we will use a Jupyter notebook to glean insights from a vast body of unstructured data. Credit goes to [Anna Quincy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anna-quincy-25042957) and [Tyler Andersen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tyler-andersen-2bb82336) for providing the initial notebook design.

We'll start with data exported from Facebook Analytics. We'll enrich the data with Watsonâ€™s Natural Language Understanding (NLU), Tone Analyzer and Visual Recognition.

The standard Facebook Analytics export features text from posts, articles, and thumbnails, along with standard Facebook performance metrics such as likes, shares, and impressions. For this exercise, we have enriched the posts content with Watson APIs to extract keywords, entities, sentiment, and tone. Similar processing could be done for the articles and thumbnail text as well. 

After data is enriched with Watson APIs, there are several different types of ways to analyze it. The Data Science Experience (DSX) provides a robust, yet flexible method of exploring the unstructured, enriched Facebook content.

This Code Pattern provides mock Facebook data, a notebook, and comes with several pre-built visualizations to jump start you with uncovering hidden insights.

When the reader has completed this Code Pattern, they will understand how to:

 * Read external data in to a DSX Jupyter notebook via DSX Object Storage and pandas DataFrames.
 * Use a Jupyter notebook and Watson APIs to enrich data unstructured data using:
     * [Natural Language Understanding](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/natural-language-understanding.html)
     * [Tone Analyzer](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/tone-analyzer.html)
     * [Visual Recognition](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/visual-recognition.html)
 * Write data from a pandas DataFrame in a DSX Jupyter notebook out to a file in DSX Object Storage.
 * Visualize and explore the enriched data with [PixieDust](https://github.com/ibm-cds-labs/pixiedust).

## Flow
1. A CSV file exported from Facebook Analytics is added to DSX Object Storage.
2. Generated code makes the file accessible as a pandas DataFrame.
3. The data is enriched with Natural Language Understanding.
4. The data is enriched with Tone Analyzer.
5. The data is enriched with Visual Recognition.
6. The enriched data can be explored with PixieDust to uncover hidden insights and create graphics to highlight them.

![](doc/source/images/List%20of%20Services.png)


## 5. Add service credentials

### 5.1 Click on the Visual Recognition Service
![](doc/source/images/Visual_Recognition.png)

### 5.2 Click on Service Credentials
![](doc/source/images/Service_Credentials.png)

### 5.3 Click on New Credentials
![](doc/source/images/New_Credential.png)

### 5.4 Click on Add 
![](doc/source/images/Add_Credential.png)

### 5.5 Click on View Credentials and then copy the api key. 
![](doc/source/images/View_Credentials.png)

### 5.6 Find the notebook cell after `1.5. Add Service Credentials From IBM Cloud for Watson Services`. Replace the <add_vr_api_key> with the copied key. 
![](doc/source/images/Replace_vr_key.png)

### 5.7 Follow the same procedure to get the username and password credentials for the Natural Language Understanding service and the Tone Analyzer service.  

![](doc/source/images/add_credentials.png)

> Note: This cell is marked as a `hidden_cell` because it will contain sensitive credentials.

## 6. Add the CSV file

### 6.1 Download the csv file from here:
https://github.com/bleonardb3/pixiedust-facebook-analysis/blob/master/data/example_facebook_data.csv

### 6.2 Right click on Raw then click on Save link as .... to save the file to the computer. 

![](doc/source/images/Download%20Data.png)

### 6.3 Add the CSV file to the notebook
Use `Find and Add Data` ![](doc/source/images/OneZero.png)
and its `Files` tab. From there you can click
`browse` and add a .csv file from your computer.

![](doc/source/images/add_file.png)

### 6.4 Insert to code
Find the notebook cell after `2.1 Load data from Object Storage`. Place your cursor after `# Insert pandas DataFrame`. Make sure this cell is selected before inserting code.

Using the file that you added above (under the ![](doc/source/images/OneZero.png) tab),
use the `Insert to code` drop-down menu.
Select `Insert Pandas DataFrame` from the drop-down menu.

![](doc/source/images/insert_to_code.png)

> Note: This cell is marked as a hidden_cell because it contains
sensitive credentials.

![](doc/source/images/inserted_pandas.png)

### 6.5  Fix-up variable names
The inserted code includes a generated method with credentials and then calls
the generated method to set a variable with a name like `df_data_1`. If you do
additional inserts, the method can be re-used and the variable will change
(e.g. `df_data_2`).

Later in the notebook, we set `df = df_data_1`. So you might need to
fix the variable name `df_data_1` to match your inserted code or vice versa.

### 6.6 Add file credentials

We want to write the enriched file to the same container that we used above. So now we'll use the same file drop-down to insert credentials. We'll use them later when we write out the enriched CSV file.

After the `df` setup, there is a cell to enter the file credentials.
Place your cursor after the `#insert credentials for file - Change to credentials_1` line. Make sure this cell is selected before inserting credentials.

Use the CSV file's drop-down menu again. This time select `Insert Credentials`.

![](doc/source/images/insert_file_credentials.png)

Note: This cell is marked as a `hidden_cell` because it contains sensitive credentials.

### 6.7 Fix-up variable names
The inserted code includes a dictionary with credentials assigned to a variable
with a name like `credentials_1`. It may have a different name (e.g. `credentials_2`).
Rename it or reassign it if needed. The notebook code assumes it will be `credentials_1`.

## 7. Run the notebook

When a notebook is executed, what is actually happening is that each code cell in
the notebook is executed, in order, from top to bottom.

Each code cell is selectable and is preceded by a tag in the left margin. The tag
format is `In [x]:`. Depending on the state of the notebook, the `x` can be:

* A blank, this indicates that the cell has never been executed.
* A number, this number represents the relative order this code step was executed.
* A `*`, this indicates that the cell is currently executing.

There are several ways to execute the code cells in your notebook:

* One cell at a time.
  * Select the cell, and then press the `Play` button in the toolbar, or select the cell, and then press Shift + Enter keys
* Batch mode, in sequential order.
  * From the `Cell` menu bar, there are several options available. For example, you
    can `Run All` cells in your notebook, or you can `Run All Below`, that will
    start executing from the first cell under the currently selected cell, and then
    continue executing all cells that follow.
* At a scheduled time.
  * Press the `Schedule` button located in the top right section of your notebook
    panel. Here you can schedule your notebook to be executed once at some future
    time, or repeatedly at your specified interval.

## 8. Analyze the results

### Part I - Enrich

If you walk through the cells, you will see that we demonstrated how to do the following in Part I:

* Install external libraries from PyPI
* Create clients to connect to Watson cognitive services
* Load data from a local CSV file to a pandas DataFrame (via Object Storage)
* Do some data manipulation with pandas
* Use BeautifulSoup
* Use Natural Language Understanding
* Use Tone Analyzer
* Use Visual Recognition
* Save the enriched data in a CSV file in Object Storage

### Part II - Data Preparation

In Part II, we used pandas to create multiple DataFrames from our main enriched DataFrame. After slicing and dicing and cleaning, these new DataFrames are ready for PixieDust to use.

### Part III - Analyze

In Part III, we analyze the results by exploring and visualizing the metrics with PixieDust.

After all the prep work done earlier, you'll see that there is almost no code
needed here (thanks to PixieDust). We just use one-liners like this:
```python
display(<data-frame>)
```

You should also notice that we used ```display(tones)``` in two different
cells, but the result was two different charts. How can that happen?
Well, we used cell metadata to tell PixieDust how to display the data.
Notice the `Edit Metadata` button on each cell. If you don't see it, use the menu
`View > Cell Toolbar > Edit Metadata` to make it visible. If you look at
the metadata for the first two charts, you'll see how we got a bar chart and a pie chart.

**PixieDust is interactive!** This is where we explore to find out what
the enriched data will tell us.

Use the `Options` button to change the chart settings. The first chart shows
post consumption by the detected emotion in the article. Notice how changing
the aggregation type from SUM to AVG gives you a very different conclusion.
You can also change it to COUNT to see the frequency of each emotion, but when you do that the metric no longer matters.

Explore by trying the following:
* Use social tone as the key instead of emotion tone (or both).
* Try other metrics such as lifetime negative feedback from users. 
* Try the different renderers.
* Try different chart types (and a grid).

The right combination will give you insights into the impact of
your facebook posts. Once you uncover the insights, find the best
presentation to convince others.

## 9. Save your work

### How to save your work:

Under the `File` menu, there are several ways to save your notebook:

* `Save` will simply save the current state of your notebook, without any version
  information.
* `Save Version` will save your current state of your notebook with a version tag
  that contains a date and time stamp. Up to 10 versions of your notebook can be
  saved, each one retrievable by selecting the `Revert To Version` menu item.
